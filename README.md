NoC-topology
============

This repository contains a research project created for a school assignment. The project explores the optimal topology for interconnection circuitry between cores of a multicore, Network-on-a-Chip (Noc) processor.

This project was implemented as a tool written in Python. Please see Drews_Final_Report.pdf for a detailed report of the goals, methodology, and results of this project. I received a grade of "A" for this assignment.

###Project Contents
The tool consists of three Python files:

1. tool.py
-this is step one of the tool which profiles the target app
      creates the novel topology
-usage: ./tool.py <maxlinks> <maxdegree> <targetapp>[ <targetappargs>]
-this outputs "novel-net-config.txt" desribing the new, novel topology
-this also outputs the other config files needed by Multi2Sim
-provides performance stats for the fully-connected topology to stdout

2. comparisons.py
-this is step two which measures the performance of the target app
      with a specified topology
-choices are "novel" (what was just generated by tool.py), "ring",
      "mesh", or "torus"
-usage: ./comparisons.py <maxlinks> <maxdegree> <topology> \
             <target app>[ <targetappargs>
-this outputs the config files needed by Multi2Sim
-provides performance stats for the specified topology to stdout

3. writeconfigs.py
-imported by both tool.py and comparisons.py
-not intended to be run directly; just a helper


###Necessary resources

1. Multi2Sim multicore hardware simulator
-available from [www.multi2sim.org](https://www.multi2sim.org/)
-need to update the path to m2s in the code of tool.py
      (at the top of the __main__ section) to reflect the path on your machine
-currently hardcoded to the absolute path to m2s in my filesystem

2. NetworkX
-Python library created by people from LANL for graph manipulation
-info at http://networkx.github.io/
-I was able to install on a school machine (running RHEL) by using simply:
      "easy_install --user networkx" 
-no manual installation required

3. PARSEC multithreaded benchmark suite
-I downloaded the pre-compiled versions from Multi2Sim; no need
      to compile them myself
-[www.multi2sim.org/benchmarks/parsec-2.1.html](http://www.multi2sim.org/benchmarks/parsec-2.1.html)
-see [parsec.cs.princeton.edu](http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu/) for more info
